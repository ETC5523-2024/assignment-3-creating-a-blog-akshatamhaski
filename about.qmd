Hey there! I’m Akshata, a Master’s student in Business Analytics at Monash University, and I’m all about using data to crack complex problems and make an impact. I’m super passionate about finding creative ways to apply data science across different industries.

Here’s what gets me excited:

Crunching numbers with business analytics
Making data visualizations that tell a story
And of course, sustainability in business (because who doesn’t love saving the planet while crunching data?)

I love rolling up my sleeves and digging into real-world projects that bring out insights and help drive innovation. If you’ve got a cool project or question where data can make a difference, let’s chat!

Feel free to reach out:
